Hi There,
My name is Harsh and as you might know this game
is the copy of old "NES" game "BattleCity(JPN)"
which was released in mid 80s.

I created this game for my own practice and to learn
more about game programming(using Java).

Below are some of the websites which i have used to
download resources for this game.
